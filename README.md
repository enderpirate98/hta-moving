## Introduction
Taking the leap and spreading your wings to explore the world can be daunting, but the feeling of freedom and happiness that comes with it is worth it. One of the initial steps to independence is moving out of your parent's house once you have a stable income. While adulthood may pose challenges, careful planning and dedication can make the process smoother. Now, let's delve into the details of how to successfully move out and establish a new living situation.

Please do watch the full video as it does truely cover everything and there is the possibility that I miss something. (I'm not perfect)

## Section 2: Key points and summery

Roommates: Do you live better alone or with others? The benefits of having roommates are: lower rent, a friend or 2, and you might feel safer traveling in groups! Of course not every roommate you have will be great but you need to decide if being social at home is worth it or not.

Money: Before you consider moving out you should have a decent stable job (if you haven't already, future guide coming eventually!) and you should save up a lot of money for when you move out. Typically it is recommended to have at least 3 months of rent saved up so that you can survive while serching for your next job if you do need a new one. You also need to look at your other future expenses such as food, internet, utilities, insurance, taxes and also whatever you need to buy up front such as furnature or other items (more on that later) You should also keep in mind that the basic items on the list account for a basic safety net and it isn't a perfect prediction so ask your parents or other trusted experianced adult to find out more. Finally don't live an extravigant lifestyle (yet) because you are still a beginner at being an adult and you still need to be realistic with what you need and what you don't need. Also there is likely a security deposit involved but please watch the video for the full explanation.

Location: Where is the general area you want to live? Is it close to home or far away? Before you find the exact place to live, ask yourself: "Where is it that I want to live?" answering this question might make your plans a little more realistic and concrete. I am done for the night but hopefully I can get back to this later.
